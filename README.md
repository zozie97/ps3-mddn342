Originally I wanted to use a repeating grid of flowers, in which each flower would rotate in different ways and at different times. But as I carried on through the project I realised I didn’t have much inspiration for it so I ended up changing my entire idea. 

I then found an example of Craig Reynolds’ Flocking algorithm in p5.js. This gave me some awesome iterations. I decided not to go with this idea either as  I was not able to make it loop so it did not fit the brief.

My final idea is inspired by the Apple ribbon screensavers/wallpapers. I wanted to see if I could create something similar using p5.js.

A lot of the design and code has been trial and error and I ended up stumbling across some parts by chance, which is one of my favourite things about creative coding. The fact that you can try something which doesn’t work the way you intended it to but it ends up being something better.

My “ribbons” are made up of small circles which are then rotating in larger circles. Its created quite a cool “flipping” effect. By giving the background an opacity value, it has created this awesome trail effect.
